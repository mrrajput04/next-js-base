## Azure App Service Deployment Disk Space Error (2/1/2025, 6:56:33 PM)

_**User**_

what the heck am I supposed to do when my azure app service deployment gives me this error:
2025-02-01T23:46:30.913Z - rsync: [receiver] close failed on "/home/site/wwwroot/.next/cache/webpack/client-production/.0.pack.87B6B6": No space left on device (28)
2025-02-01T23:46:30.923Z - rsync error: error in file IO (code 11) at receiver.c(888) [receiver=3.2.7]
2025-02-01T23:46:31.013Z - rsync: [sender] write error: Broken pipe (32)

---

_**Assistant**_

This error indicates that your Azure App Service instance has run out of disk space during deployment, specifically while trying to sync the Next.js build cache. This is a common issue with Next.js deployments on Azure App Service, especially with larger applications. Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Clear the build cache** - Add this to your deployment script or run it manually:
```bash
rm -rf .next/cache/*
```

2. **Configure Azure to skip the `.next/cache` directory** - Create or update your `.deployment` file to exclude the cache directory from deployment.

3. **Increase your Azure App Service disk quota** - By default, Azure App Service has limited storage. You can:
   - Go to Azure Portal
   - Select your App Service
   - Go to Configuration → General settings
   - Increase the "Local Cache" size or upgrade your service plan if needed

4. **Add a `.gitignore` entry** to prevent cache from being included in deployments:
```text
.next/cache/*
```

5. **Configure Next.js to use a different cache directory** - You can add this to your `.env.local`:

```env:.env.local
// ... existing code ...
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
BUILD_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/.next/cache
// ... existing code ...
```

The most immediate solution is usually clearing the cache before deployment. If this keeps happening, you might want to consider upgrading your App Service plan or implementing a more permanent caching strategy.

Would you like me to provide more details about any of these solutions?

I'd like you to explain the .next/cache generally.  what are we caching there?

---

_**Assistant**_



The `.next/cache` directory is Next.js's built-in caching system that primarily stores build-time artifacts. Here's a breakdown of what's typically stored there:

1. **Webpack Cache** (`/cache/webpack/`)
   - Compiled JavaScript bundles
   - Processed module dependencies
   - Chunk optimization results
   - This dramatically speeds up subsequent builds by not having to recompile unchanged files

2. **Images Cache** (`/cache/images/`)
   - Optimized versions of images when using Next.js Image Optimization
   - Different sizes and formats of the same image for different devices/viewports

3. **Fetch Cache** (`/cache/fetch/`)
   - Data from fetch requests that use `fetch-cache` directives
   - Helps with static and dynamic data fetching optimization

4. **Server Components Cache** (`/cache/server/`)
   - Cached React Server Components
   - Compiled server-side code

The cache is particularly useful during development and between builds because:
- It can reduce build times from minutes to seconds
- It prevents unnecessary recompilation of unchanged code
- It optimizes resource usage for image processing
- It improves development server performance

However, this cache isn't typically needed in production environments after deployment, which is why it's safe to clear it during deployment processes. The production server will generate its own cache as needed.

A typical production build might generate several gigabytes of cache data, which explains why you might run into disk space issues on constrained environments like Azure App Service.

_**User**_

You mentioned changing my .deployment file for Azure.  Where would this .deployment file be?  I'm using Azure App Services Extensions in vscode.

---

_**Assistant**_



The `.deployment` file is a configuration file that should be placed in the root of your project (same level as your `.gitignore`). However, for modern Azure App Service deployments, especially when using the VS Code extension, it's more common and recommended to use a `.deployment.json` file or configure deployment settings through the `azure-pipelines.yml` file or directly in the Azure Portal.

For your specific case using VS Code's Azure App Service extension, here are the recommended approaches (in order of preference):

1. **Using Azure Portal Settings**:
   - Go to your App Service in the Azure Portal
   - Navigate to Configuration → Path mappings
   - Add exclusion paths there

2. **Using `.deployment.json`**:
```json:.deployment.json
{
  "skip_files": [
    ".next/cache"
  ]
}
```

3. **Using deployment script in `package.json`**:
```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "rm -rf .next/cache/*",
    "deploy": "your-deploy-command"
  }
}
```

4. **Using `.deployment`** (legacy approach):
```text:.deployment
[config]
SCM_SKIP_NEXT_CACHE=1
```

The VS Code Azure App Service extension typically uses the Kudu deployment engine under the hood, which will respect these settings. However, the most reliable approach would be to:

1. First try clearing the cache before deployment using a pre-deploy script
2. If issues persist, configure the skip paths in the Azure Portal
3. If you need more control, add the `.deployment.json` configuration

Would you like me to explain how to configure any of these approaches in more detail?

_**Assistant**_



Ah, now we're seeing the same "No space left on device" error, but this time with `node_modules`. This suggests that even after clearing the Next.js cache, your deployment is still too large for the default Azure App Service storage allocation. Here are the steps to address this:

1. **Check your current disk usage** in Azure Portal:
   - Go to your App Service
   - Under "Development Tools", click on "Advanced Tools" (Kudu)
   - Click on "Debug Console" → "PowerShell"
   - Run `du -h /home` to see disk usage

2. **Increase your App Service Plan size**:
   - Basic (B1) has 10GB storage
   - Standard (S1) has more storage
   - Premium plans have even more

3. **Optimize your `node_modules`**:
```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npm prune",
    "postinstall": "npm dedupe"
  }
}
```

4. **Consider using production-only dependencies**:
Move development dependencies that aren't needed in production to `devDependencies`:
```json:package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Keep only what's needed for production
    "@chakra-ui/react": "^2.8.2",
    "next": "^14.2.23",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
    // ... other production dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Move testing and development tools here
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.2",
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.12"
    // ... other dev dependencies
  }
}
```

Then install with:
```bash
npm install --production
```

5. **Configure Azure to use production installations**:
   - In Azure Portal, go to Configuration
   - Add an App Setting:
     - Name: `NODE_ENV`
     - Value: `production`

The most immediate solution would be to upgrade your App Service Plan to one with more storage. What tier are you currently using? I can provide specific storage allocation recommendations based on your tier.

---

_**User**_

What's the storage size of the Free plan?

---

_**Assistant**_



The Free (F1) plan in Azure App Service has a very limited storage capacity of just **1GB**. This is quite restrictive and explains why you're running into space issues, especially considering:

1. A typical Next.js production build can be several hundred MB
2. `node_modules` for a modern React/Next.js app can easily be 200-500MB
3. Your `.next` build directory adds more space requirements
4. Any assets, images, or other files in your project take additional space

For comparison, here are the storage limits for different tiers:
- Free (F1): 1GB
- Shared/Basic (B1): 10GB
- Standard (S1): 50GB
- Premium (P1v2): 250GB

For a production Next.js application, you'll typically want at least a Basic (B1) plan. If you're just testing/developing, you might want to consider:

1. Using a more minimal set of dependencies
2. Removing development dependencies
3. Clearing caches before deployment
4. Using asset optimization techniques

However, the most straightforward solution would be to upgrade to at least a Basic (B1) plan if you're planning to deploy a full Next.js application.

_**User**_

what npm command should I use to see all the modules that are loaded?

---

_**Assistant**_



There are a few useful npm commands to inspect your dependencies:

1. **List all installed packages** (including nested dependencies):
```bash
npm list
```

2. **List only top-level packages** (more readable):
```bash
npm list --depth=0
```

3. **List production dependencies only**:
```bash
npm list --prod --depth=0
```

4. **List development dependencies only**:
```bash
npm list --dev --depth=0
```

5. **See the size of packages** (this is very useful for your case):
```bash
npm list -g --depth=0 --parseable | xargs du -sh
```

6. **Find the largest packages** (requires `npx`):
```bash
npx cost-of-modules
```

You can also use specialized tools like `package-size` to analyze your dependency sizes:
```bash
npx package-size
```

Given your storage constraints on the free tier, I'd recommend running both the depth=0 list and a size analysis to identify which packages are taking up the most space. This can help you make informed decisions about which dependencies you might be able to remove or move to devDependencies.

_**User**_

how can I similar a production npm install?

---

_**Assistant**_



There are a few ways to simulate a production npm install:

1. **Most direct way** - Install only production dependencies:
```bash
npm install --production
# or
npm ci --production
```

2. **Clean install approach** (recommended for testing):
```bash
# Remove existing modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json

# Fresh install of production dependencies
npm install --production
```

3. **Using NODE_ENV** (simulates production environment):
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm install
```

The key differences between these commands:
- `npm install --production` - Skips devDependencies
- `npm ci --production` - More strict, uses package-lock.json exactly, and is generally faster
- Both will ignore anything in the `devDependencies` section of your package.json

For your Azure deployment issue, I'd recommend testing with `npm ci --production` locally first, as this most closely matches what would happen in a production environment. This will help you understand exactly how much space your production dependencies are actually using.

@Codebase Given this output:
are there any modules that I can reduce?

---

_**Assistant**_



Looking at your dependencies and the codebase, there are several opportunities to reduce modules:

1. **Production Dependencies in devDependencies**
Several packages that should be in `dependencies` are incorrectly listed in `devDependencies`:
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- `@chakra-ui/next-js`
- `@chakra-ui/react`
- `@emotion/react`
- `@emotion/styled`
- `framer-motion`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `mongoose`
- `next`
- `next-swagger-doc`
- `openai`
- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `swagger-ui-dist`
- `winston`

2. **Unnecessary Development Dependencies**
Some packages can be removed if you're not actively using them:
- `@types/swagger-ui-react` (you're using swagger-ui-dist instead)
- `css-loader` and `style-loader` (Next.js has built-in CSS handling)

3. **Duplicate Dependencies**
You have some dependencies that are included by other packages:
- `@emotion/react` and `@emotion/styled` (included by Chakra UI)

Here's how to fix this:

1. First, remove unnecessary packages:
```bash
npm uninstall @types/swagger-ui-react css-loader style-loader
```

2. Move production dependencies to the correct section in package.json:
```json:package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@anthropic-ai/sdk": "^0.17.1",
    "@chakra-ui/next-js": "^2.2.0",
    "@chakra-ui/react": "^2.8.2",
    "@emotion/react": "^11.11.3",
    "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0",
    "framer-motion": "^11.0.3",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.1.1",
    "next": "^14.2.23",
    "next-swagger-doc": "^0.4.0",
    "openai": "^4.26.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "swagger-ui-dist": "^5.18.3",
    "winston": "^3.11.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.2",
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.12",
    "@types/jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.5",
    "@types/node": "^20.11.16",
    "@types/react": "^18.2.52",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.18",
    "eslint": "^8.56.0",
    "eslint-config-next": "14.1.0",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.7.0",
    "next-router-mock": "^0.9.12",
    "typescript": "^5.3.3"
  }
}
```

After making these changes, run:
```bash
npm install --production
```

This should significantly reduce your node_modules size for production deployment.

what's in the .next static chunks folder

---

_**Assistant**_



The `.next/static/chunks` folder contains webpack-generated JavaScript chunks that are part of Next.js's build output. These chunks include:

1. **Page Chunks**
   - Individual JavaScript bundles for each page
   - Named like `pages-[hash].js`

2. **Shared Chunks**
   - Common code shared between multiple pages
   - Framework code (React, Next.js core)
   - Named like `framework-[hash].js`
   - Shared components and utilities

3. **Library Chunks**
   - Third-party dependencies bundled separately
   - Named like `node_modules_[package-name]_[hash].js`

You can analyze what's taking up space using:
```bash
npx next build --debug
# or
ANALYZE=true npx next build
```

To reduce chunk sizes:

1. **Add to next.config.js**:
```javascript:next.config.js
// ... existing code ...
const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
        serverActions: {
            bodySizeLimit: '2mb',
        },
    },
    // Add optimization configuration
    webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
        if (!dev && !isServer) {
            config.optimization = {
                ...config.optimization,
                splitChunks: {
                    chunks: 'all',
                    minSize: 20000,
                    maxSize: 244000,
                    cacheGroups: {
                        framework: {
                            name: 'framework',
                            chunks: 'all',
                            test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](react|react-dom|scheduler|next)[\\/]/,
                            priority: 40,
                        },
                        commons: {
                            name: 'commons',
                            chunks: 'all',
                            minChunks: 2,
                            priority: 20,
                        },
                    },
                },
            };
        }
        return config;
    },
};
```

This configuration will:
- Split chunks more aggressively
- Group framework code together
- Limit individual chunk sizes
- Cache common code more effectively

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the chunk optimization in more detail?

_**User**_

is anything in the .next folder absolutely crucial?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, certain parts of the `.next` folder are crucial for production deployment, while others can be safely ignored or deleted. Here's the breakdown:

**Crucial - DO NOT DELETE:**
```
.next/
├── server/           # Server-side code (REQUIRED)
│   ├── app/         # Server components
│   ├── pages/       # API routes and pages
│   └── chunks/      # Server chunks
├── static/          # Static assets (REQUIRED)
│   ├── [buildId]/  # Build-specific assets
│   └── media/      # Optimized images
└── BUILD_ID        # Build identifier (REQUIRED)
```

**Not Crucial - Can be Deleted:**
```
.next/
├── cache/          # Build cache (can delete)
│   ├── webpack/   # Webpack compilation cache
│   └── images/    # Image optimization cache
├── trace/          # Build traces (can delete)
└── types/          # TypeScript types (regenerated on build)
```

For deployment to Azure App Service, you really only need:
1. `.
