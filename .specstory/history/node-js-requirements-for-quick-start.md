Add a small paragraph at the beginning of the Quick Start section that describes the node.js requirements and how/where to find instructions for loading Node.js on Windows or MacOS

I'll add a paragraph about Node.js requirements to the Quick Start section.

````markdown:README.md

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
This project requires Node.js version 18.17 or later. If you don't have Node.js installed:
- **Windows/macOS**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

You can verify your Node.js installation by running `node --version` in your terminal.

1. Clone and install:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd next-js-base
   npm install
   ```

// ... existing code ...
````

I've added a "Prerequisites" subsection at the beginning of Quick Start that explains the Node.js version requirement and provides links to the official Node.js website for installation. This helps users ensure they have the correct environment before starting the project setup.
