While this isn't directly related to the env file you shared, I can help you with clearing localStorage in your browser. There are a few ways to do this:

1. Using JavaScript in the browser console or in your code:
```javascript
// Clear all items in localStorage
localStorage.clear();

// Or remove a specific item
localStorage.removeItem('specific_key');
```

2. If you want to do this manually in your browser:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
   - Go to the "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
   - Find "Local Storage" in the left sidebar
   - Right-click on your domain and select "Clear" or click the "Clear All" button

Choose whichever method works best for your needs. The JavaScript method is useful if you need to do this programmatically, while the manual method is good for development and testing.
