## Fixing 404 Console Errors (1/31/2025, 2:55:52 PM)

_**User**_

We need to fix some console errors.

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help investigate and fix the 404 console errors. However, I notice that you haven't shared the specific URLs or resources that are returning 404 errors. Could you please:

1. Share the specific URLs that are returning 404 errors from your browser's console
2. Share the relevant code where these resources are being requested

This information would help me pinpoint exactly where the issue is occurring and provide a more targeted fix. The files you've shared suggest this might be related to API routes or configuration, but I need more details about the specific failing requests to provide an accurate solution.

In the meantime, here are some common areas to check for 404 errors:

1. API route paths matching exactly
2. Missing or incorrect environment variables
3. Incorrect URL construction in frontend requests
4. Missing or incorrectly configured API handlers

Could you please share the specific error details from your console?

_**Assistant**_

I see - the error is coming from trying to load a CSS source map for Swagger UI. This is happening because the CSS map file isn't being served correctly.

For Next.js applications, we need to properly configure the handling of Swagger UI's static assets. Let's fix this by creating a proper API route to serve the Swagger UI assets.

Here's how we can fix this:

```typescript:src/app/api/docs/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { serve } from 'swagger-ui-express'
import swaggerDocument from '@/lib/swagger.json'
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs'

// ... existing code ...

export async function GET(request: Request) {
    const url = new URL(request.url)
    
    // Handle swagger-ui static assets
    if (url.pathname.includes('swagger-ui')) {
        const filePath = url.pathname.split('/api/docs/')[1]
        if (filePath.endsWith('.map')) {
            // For source maps, return empty 200 response to prevent console errors
            return new NextResponse('', {
                status: 200,
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
            })
        }
    }

    // ... rest of your existing swagger handling code ...
}
```

This solution:

1. Checks if the request is for a Swagger UI asset
2. For source map files (.map), returns an empty 200 response instead of a 404
3. This prevents the console errors while not affecting functionality

The error you're seeing is not actually problematic - it's just trying to load source maps for development purposes. This solution will suppress the console errors while maintaining all functionality.

Alternatively, if you want to completely disable source maps for Swagger UI CSS, you could add this to your Next.js config:

```javascript:next.config.js
module.exports = {
    // ... other config options ...
    webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
        if (!dev) {
            config.devtool = false;
        }
        return config;
    },
}
```

Choose the solution that best fits your needs:
1. The first solution (API route modification) if you want to handle the requests properly
2. The webpack config change if you want to disable source maps entirely in production

---

_**User**_

I think we need to revert that change.  when I look in the .next folder and follow that down the path. I dont see a swagger-ui.css.map file.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right - let's revert those changes since they're not addressing the root cause. The issue seems to be that we're trying to use `swagger-ui-express` which is meant for Express.js servers, not Next.js API routes.

Let's clean up the file:

```typescript:src/app/api/docs/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { getApiDocs } from '../../../lib/swagger';

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json(getApiDocs());
}
```

And let's revert the next.config.js changes:

```javascript:next.config.js
// ... existing code ...
```

For serving Swagger UI in Next.js, we should either:
1. Use a React-based Swagger UI component in a page component
2. Or serve the static Swagger UI files properly through Next.js public directory

Would you like me to show you how to implement either of these approaches instead? That would be a more appropriate solution for Next.js than using `swagger-ui-express`.

---

_**User**_

Which of those options is the simplest for me to understand?  Let's pick that one.

---

_**Assistant**_



The simplest approach would be to use a React-based Swagger UI component in a page component. This is straightforward because:

1. It's just a React component you can import and use
2. No need to handle static files manually
3. Works well with Next.js out of the box

Let's create a new page for the Swagger UI documentation:

```typescript:src/app/api-docs/page.tsx
'use client';

import SwaggerUI from 'swagger-ui-react';
import 'swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css';

export default function ApiDocs() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
      <SwaggerUI url="/api/docs" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

You'll need to install the required package:

```bash
npm install swagger-ui-react
```

This will:
1. Create a new page at `/api-docs`
2. Fetch the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation from your existing `/api/docs` endpoint
3. Display it using the official Swagger UI React component

The `'use client'` directive is needed because Swagger UI is a client-side component.

This is the simplest solution because it's just one component that handles everything for you, and it integrates naturally with your existing API docs endpoint.

_**User**_

Check over the code in context and re-verify it's correctness since you've been changing things without the appropriate understanding of all of the source.

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the full context, I notice a few important details:

1. The application is using Chakra UI for styling
2. There's already a navigation setup with an "API Docs" link
3. The project has a proper layout structure with providers

Let me revise the API docs page to better integrate with the existing setup:

```typescript:src/app/api-docs/page.tsx
'use client';

import SwaggerUI from 'swagger-ui-react';
import 'swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css';
import { Box, Container, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react';

export default function ApiDocs() {
  return (
    <Container maxW="container.xl" py={10}>
      <Box mb={6}>
        <Heading as="h1" size="xl">
          API Documentation
        </Heading>
      </Box>
      <Box 
        sx={{
          '.swagger-ui': {
            'font-family': 'inherit',
          }
        }}
      >
        <SwaggerUI url="/api/docs" />
      </Box>
    </Container>
  );
}
```

This revised version:

1. Uses Chakra UI components to maintain consistent styling
2. Matches the layout pattern used in other pages (like config/page.tsx)
3. Adds proper heading and container structure
4. Includes some basic styling to better integrate Swagger UI with Chakra UI

You'll still need to:

1. Install the required package:
```bash
npm install swagger-ui-react
```

2. Add a type declaration for the CSS import. Create a new file:

```typescript:src/types/swagger-ui-react.d.ts
declare module 'swagger-ui-react' {
  const SwaggerUI: React.ComponentType<{ url?: string }>;
  export default SwaggerUI;
}

declare module 'swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css' {
  const content: any;
  export default content;
}
```

This solution better integrates with your existing codebase while maintaining the simplicity of the Swagger UI implementation.

console.log errors from the api-docs page.tsx
Using kebab-case for css properties in objects is not supported. Did you mean fontFamily?

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, let's fix the CSS property name. In JavaScript/TypeScript objects, we need to use camelCase for CSS properties instead of kebab-case:

```typescript:src/app/api-docs/page.tsx
'use client';

import SwaggerUI from 'swagger-ui-react';
import 'swagger-ui-react/swagger-ui.css';
import { Box, Container, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react';

export default function ApiDocs() {
  return (
    <Container maxW="container.xl" py={10}>
      <Box mb={6}>
        <Heading as="h1" size="xl">
          API Documentation
        </Heading>
      </Box>
      <Box 
        sx={{
          '.swagger-ui': {
            fontFamily: 'inherit'
          }
        }}
      >
        <SwaggerUI url="/api/docs" />
      </Box>
    </Container>
  );
}
```

The change is from `'font-family'` to `fontFamily`. This follows the standard JavaScript style for CSS-in-JS where hyphenated CSS properties are converted to camelCase.

I also see this error: Warning: Using UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in strict mode is not recommended and may indicate bugs in your code. See https://reactjs.org/link/unsafe-component-lifecycles for details.


---

_**Assistant**_



This warning is coming from the `swagger-ui-react` package itself, which is using legacy React lifecycle methods. Unfortunately, we can't fix the internal implementation of the package, but we have a few options:

1. Use a different package like `swagger-ui-dist` with a custom wrapper
2. Suppress the warning
3. Use a newer alternative package

Let's try option 1 since it gives us more control and removes the warning. Here's the updated implementation:

```typescript:src/app/api-docs/page.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import SwaggerUIBundle from 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle';
import 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui.css';
import { Box, Container, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react';

export default function ApiDocs() {
  const swaggerUI = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (swaggerUI.current) {
      SwaggerUIBundle({
        url: '/api/docs',
        dom_id: '#swagger-ui',
        deepLinking: true,
        presets: [
          SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis,
          SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset
        ],
        layout: "BaseLayout",
      });
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <Container maxW="container.xl" py={10}>
      <Box mb={6}>
        <Heading as="h1" size="xl">
          API Documentation
        </Heading>
      </Box>
      <Box 
        id="swagger-ui"
        ref={swaggerUI}
        sx={{
          '.swagger-ui': {
            fontFamily: 'inherit'
          }
        }}
      />
    </Container>
  );
}
```

You'll need to update the dependencies:

```bash
npm remove swagger-ui-react
npm install swagger-ui-dist
```

And update the type declaration file:

```typescript:src/types/swagger-ui-react.d.ts
declare module 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle' {
  const SwaggerUIBundle: any;
  export default SwaggerUIBundle;
}

declare module 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui.css' {
  const content: any;
  export default content;
}
```

This solution:
1. Uses the lower-level swagger-ui-dist package
2. Implements a custom wrapper using modern React patterns
3. Removes the legacy lifecycle method warnings
4. Maintains the same functionality and appearance
5. Gives us more control over the initialization and configuration

---

_**User**_

are there any files I should remove given this change?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, since we've switched from `swagger-ui-react` to `swagger-ui-dist`, we should:

1. Rename the type declaration file to better reflect its contents:

```bash
mv src/types/swagger-ui-react.d.ts src/types/swagger-ui-dist.d.ts
```

2. Update package.json to remove the old dependency (you can do this with):

```bash
npm remove swagger-ui-react
```

The type declaration file's name change better reflects what it's actually declaring types for now. The old name might be confusing for future maintenance since we're no longer using the React-specific package.

Would you like me to show you the commands to execute these changes, or would you prefer to handle them manually?

Now we're back to Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) with http://localhost:3000/_next/static/css/app/api-docs/swagger-ui.css.map

---

_**Assistant**_



Looking at this error again, I realize we need to properly handle the static assets in Next.js. Let's modify the Next.js config to handle these static files:

```javascript:next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config options ...

  // Configure webpack to handle swagger-ui-dist assets
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /swagger-ui-dist.*\.css$/,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
    });

    return config;
  },

  // Configure headers to handle source map requests
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/_next/static/css/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Content-Type',
            value: 'text/css',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

You'll also need to install the required loaders:

```bash
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```

This configuration will:
1. Properly handle the Swagger UI CSS files
2. Set appropriate headers for CSS and source map requests
3. Integrate the static assets with Next.js's build process

The 404 error for the source map should be resolved after applying these changes and restarting your development server.

_**Assistant**_



Ah, I see the issue now. We need a different approach for handling the Swagger UI CSS in Next.js. Let's modify our configuration:

```javascript:next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    // ... other config options ...
    webpack: (config, { dev, isServer }) => {
        if (!dev) {
            config.devtool = false;
        }
        return config;
    },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

And let's modify our API docs page to use the CSS directly from a CDN instead:

```typescript:src/app/api-docs/page.tsx
'use client';

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import SwaggerUIBundle from 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle';
import { Box, Container, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react';

export default function ApiDocs() {
  const swaggerUI = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (swaggerUI.current) {
      // Add Swagger UI CSS
      const link = document.createElement('link');
      link.type = 'text/css';
      link.rel = 'stylesheet';
      link.href = 'https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist@5.11.0/swagger-ui.css';
      document.head.appendChild(link);

      SwaggerUIBundle({
        url: '/api/docs',
        dom_id: '#swagger-ui',
        deepLinking: true,
        presets: [
          SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis,
          SwaggerUIBundle.SwaggerUIStandalonePreset
        ],
        layout: "BaseLayout",
      });
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <Container maxW="container.xl" py={10}>
      <Box mb={6}>
        <Heading as="h1" size="xl">
          API Documentation
        </Heading>
      </Box>
      <Box 
        id="swagger-ui"
        ref={swaggerUI}
        sx={{
          '.swagger-ui': {
            fontFamily: 'inherit'
          }
        }}
      />
    </Container>
  );
}
```

This approach:
1. Removes the need for complex webpack configuration
2. Uses the CDN version of the Swagger UI CSS
3. Dynamically adds the CSS when the component mounts
4. Should resolve the CSS loading errors

You can also remove the CSS import from the type declarations:

```typescript:src/types/swagger-ui-dist.d.ts
declare module 'swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle' {
  const SwaggerUIBundle: any;
  export default SwaggerUIBundle;
}
```
