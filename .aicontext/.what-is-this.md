# .ai context

This directory contains potential context for the AI.
THIS FOLDER IS INCLUDED IN THE REPO _ BUT IS IGNORED BY CURSOR (See .cursorignore)

When using Cursor, sometimes you want to provide the AI with more context than just the current file.  Code examples, standards, etc.
Just copy these files to the 'real' .context folder and reference them via the @ references or whatever other method you prefer.

This directory contains files that can be used to provide this context.
